- pip install -r requirements.txt (if you haven't already)

- modify setup.py with new version number
  - git commit before tagging!

- git tag with new version number

- clear old contents from dist folder (only important before twine upload)


- Generate distribution archives
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  
  
- Upload the distribution archives
    - To Test PyPi
    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    
    - Test with
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package_name
    
    - To PyPi
    twine upload dist/*
    
    - use with
    pip install package_name
    pip install --upgrade package_name==new.version.number 
    (e.g. pip install --upgrade eve-utils==1.2.0 )
    (pip install --upgrade is supposed to upgrade to latest, but I haven't seen it work, esp. 0.5.1 => 0.5.2)
